# PlayerShelf

Backend PlayerShelf where you can track your games.

## Core Goals

These are the goals that I'll keep in mind when create new features or taking decisions. PS: The goals can change, as always.

- Be able to track my Games (Played, to play, playing and any onther relevant status)
- Overview over my library (How many games I have, in wich platform and etc.)
- Wich platform I have the game (Is any subscription ?, or I bought the game ?)
- Create custom list (Nice to have some base list like games by platform, for example)

## Bonus Goals

Some things that are nice to have, if possible.

- Played hours (In each platform)
- Price tracking/alerts (Be able to set the price that I paid for the game, in each platform, to calculate the total)
- Release calendar
